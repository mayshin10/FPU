# Floating Point Unit
It is a verilog design and synthesis for 32-bits FPU following IEEE 754 standard. Four calculation modes are supported; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. All calculations are showing results within two cycles at 250MHz clock frequency.

* input
   * ```clk```
   * ```reset```
   * ```2-bits selection signal```
      * 2'b00: add
      * 2'b01: sub
      * 2'b10: mul
      * 2'b11: div
   * ```1-bit rounding mode selection signal```
      * ```1'b0: rounding ties to even```
      * ```1'b1: rounding down```
   * ```1-bit start signal```
   * ```32-bit floating point operand A, B```
* output
   * ```32-bit floating point result Y```
   * ```1-bit Overflow```
   * ```1-bit Error```

Other features
---------------------------------------------
* Rounding rules
To achieve efficiency of operation, round to the ```8th digit``` after the decimal point.
   * ```Rounding ties to even```
      * Rounding up or rounding down to nearest value
      * If there are two nearest values, choosing round up or down which makes last fraction bit even
   * ```Rounding down```
      * Always round down toward -&infin;

* Exception handling
    * Invalid operation
        when NaN occurs, return NaN, return error 1
    * Division by zero
        Return &infin, return overflow 1
    * Overflow
        Return &infin, return overflow 1
